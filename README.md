# its-time
if you are reading this, im most likely gone. 
this is a result of constantly being verbally abused, treated like shit, and depression.
i know my school friends probably wont see this but i just want to thank them for always being good to me when no one else was.
i want to thank all my online friends for also being nice.
i know this probably isnt a good idea, but i honestly dgaf anymore.
of all the 7-8 attempts that have failed, this one wont
i would hope that id be missed but who am i kidding. no one fucking loves me in this shithole of a world
bullied. depressed. lonely. 
as a final message i hope all that have been good to me will have the best lives ever. 
again thanks to everyone that has noticed me in this hell.
tuesday. after school. im gone. forever.
goodbye.
